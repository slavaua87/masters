Results for $RT$ preprocessing with chance performance cutoff for the fast and 3 sds for the slow responses:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Accuracy of responses in 150 - 200 window is  0.55 and in 200 - 250 window it is 0.62. The overall accuracy for RTs below 200 is 0.51. The lower cutoff results in removing 123 observations.

\item For subject ``jf'' the accuracy in 200 - 250 is 0.63, in 150 - 200 is 0.46 and below 200 is 0.43. Throwing out 51 if cut below 200.

\item For subject ``kr'' the accuracy in 200 - 250 is 0.61, in 150 - 200 is 0.63 and below 200 is 0.57, below 190 is 0.51. Cutting below 190 results in 45 and below 200 in 68.	

For subject ``nh'' the accuracy in 200 - 250 is 0.61, in 150 - 200 is 0.5 and below 200 is 0.5. 4 observations below 200.
\end{enumerate}

I can use sample path points to test accuracy of the integration used for predictions of rt distributions.

\section{16/01/2015}
It will be faster if I only simulate \delta and \beta, but this undermines the test of integration accuracy for the $RT$ distribution. I could integrate just the decision time density as a test.

\section{17/01/2015}
Combining data.frames for different parameters required custom functions. Maybe if dplyr was understood then data organization would be different and workable.

\section{22/01/2015}
Simulating sample paths may create RAM issues if not saved intermediately to disk. Such operation requires ``Big Data'' libraries like ff or bigmemory. 

\section{23/01/2015}
Need to set up SSH connection to Giverny to avoid laptop destruction.

\section{25/01/2015}
Started using git branching for each piece of the project. Gonna practice branching-merging with time series plots. Also, data.frame is proving to be ubiqutois and may need to reshape my list of means into long data.frames to pass to ggplot. 

\section{26/01/2015}
Used reshape2 to melt lists into data frames. Learned dplyr - very useful. May need to produce graphs on giverny given the memory limitations. Layout of samples paths is not clear yet - 11 look better than 22 per plot.

\section{17/02/2015}
Moving to the second part.
