1. Problem: Movement selection guided by analogue, noisy sensory signal
Speeded, free response task. Ratcliff-Rouder example.

2. Modeling targets - selection mechanism, adaptation and learning
Typical models concentrate on selection mechanism.

3. Adaptation can be characterized by auto-correlation and cross-correlation of mechanism parameters.
Focus on cross-correlation. 
Some data supporting cross-correlation.

4. Copulas as descriptive models of parameter co-variation across-trials.
Sklar's theorem
Corollaries
Numerical example
Visual example

5. Proposed generalizations of the Ratcliff models
Reasons for choices
Properties of copula-based parameter models

6. Problems to be addressed:
a. Theoretical - Predictions of mean sample paths, conditional densities and their properties.
Methods

b. Empirical - Estimating correlation structure, comparing posterior predictions against data, model selection.
Methods
