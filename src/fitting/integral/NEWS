planar 1.5.2

NEW FEATURES

* full field profile under gaussian beam illumination (reflection and transmission)

* new functions multilayerfull and multilayer_field calculating internal field for a given incident field

USER VISIBLE CHANGES:

* slight changes to the interface of field_profile

LOW LEVEL:

* rewrote the gaussian beam code to use multilayer matrix transfer method

* link to cubature at c++ level to perform the gaussian beam integration


planar 1.5

USER VISIBLE CHANGES:

* initial version of gaussian beam calculations (single layer, incomplete)

* removed demos (see wiki instead)

* more consistent variable names and output

* angles are in radians, distances in nanometres

BUG FIX:

* (Rcpp::)function namespace issues with some c++ compilers

LOW LEVEL:

* tests

* vignettes moved to vignettes/

planar 1.3.1

BUG FIX:

* fixed missing prefactor in transmission coefficient when incident / outgoing media were not vacuum
