    Probabilities
        1. MC errors are inversely related to response proportion. Standard 
        errors range from 0.2 - 1.
        2. For all alpha/nu combinations effect of the dependent models 
        is tiny, 0.2 - 1.2%, sometimes higher than the indep and
        other times lower.
        3. Effect of the df parameter relative to normal is also tiny,
        .05 - .5%.
        4. Effect seems to be within MC error revealing little effect on 
        proportion.
        5. Plots are not useful
    Response times
        1. Association generally slows down correct responses and speeds up
        errors, except 6, 7, 8 where correct or error responses break the trend.
        2. Weak trend of sd decrease in correct rts, and increases in errors.
        3. Can lead to assymetry reversals (1, 2, 5) and generally produce 
        (7 exception) assymetry effects on the smaller scale due to effects on
        correct and error responses
        4. Noticeable, but complex effects are produced at low correlation
        5. Plots show an effect, but a priori would be hard to clearly 
        determine it
    QP plots
        1. Assymetry is slightly reversed under speed with correct been slower
        than errors, and somewhat in accuracy,
        with reduction with accuracy.
        2. Df shows noticeable effect for smaller probability errors
        and 0.9 quantile
        3. Noticeable assymetry for n/t, especially under speed. Also under
        speed there is apparent flip in assymetry relative to i. And flip
        between n and t under accuracy.
        4. Slight improvement under in accuracy under accuracy, and slight
        reduction under speed

    Probabilities
        1. For all alpha/nu combinations effect of the dependent models 
        is tiny, 0.22 - 1.1%, sometimes higher than the indep and
        other times lower.
        2. Effect of the df parameter relative to normal is also tiny,
        .08 - .73%.
        3. Effect seems to be within MC error revealing little effect on 
        proportion.
        4. Plots are useless
    Response times
        1. Association always slows down correct responses and speeds up
        errors.
        2. Weak trend of sd decrease in correct rts, and decrease in errors,

        4. Noticeable, but complex RT effects
        5. Plots show a shape change
    QP plots
        1. Assymetry is obviously reversed under speed with correct getting
        slower and errors faster. Under accuracy, reversal occurs from fast
        to intermediate and assymetry is reduced moderately slow to slow.
        2. Df shows some effect for smaller probability errors
        and 0.7/0.9 quantile.
        3. Strong assymetry for n/t, especially under speed. Assymetries are
        opposite between n/t, and the pattern flips between speed/accuracy.
        4. Slight improvement under in accuracy under accuracy, and slight
        reduction under speed

        4. Plots are useless
    Response times
        1. Association always slows down correct responses and speeds up
        errors. The trend is most clear at this level of association. The 
        trend wears of with higher accuracy rate. 
        2. SD decrease in correct and error rts for speeded
        responses. Under the accuracy condition the pattern roughly 
        switches to lower correct and higher error sd.
        3. Can lead to assymetry reversals except in 1, 7, 8.
        4. Noticeable, but complex RT effects
        5. Plots show a clear shape change
    QP plots
        1. The effect is to speed up errors and slow down correct for the most part.
        Assymetry is extremely reversed under speed with correct getting
        slower, except in .7 under higher acc. and in .9 where it actually
        speeds up. Errors are faster for all quantiles and drive the assymetry
        reversal. Under accuracy, effect is the same and reversal holds
        from .1 to .5, but .7 and .9 only show speed up in errors.
        2. Df shows some effect for smaller probability errors
        and 0.7/0.9 quantile.
        3. Strong assymetry for n/t, especially under speed. Assymetries are
        opposite between n/t under speed and becomes aligned for accuracy.
        4. Slight decrease in accuracy under accuracy, and slight
        reduction under speed
